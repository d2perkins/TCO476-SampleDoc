This is a picture of me taken over the summer with Winshape Camps! It was a great and hot summer where I got to travel all over the southeast as my team's media specialist.

Here's some cool facts about me:
-My name is Davis, named after my mother's maden name
-I'm from Covington, GA
-My dad is from Texas and my mom is from Florida, they met in the (kinda) middle and had a family.
-I love skiing
-I've eaten Chick-Fil-A on a Sunday in the restaurant
-Way back when I used to play baseball
-I enjoy photography and vidography
-I'm just out here chasin' a degree
